# arch-anstallation-easy
so, i was thinking and i decided to create a python script that makes arch instalation almost automatic. BUT! there may be bugs because its in a super beta, i tested it tho and haven't got any errors, please open a issue if you get an error




Why? because i was bored and decided to do this, but i will update it i promise

!note! the script will fail when you have created your user, but this error does not affect to the installation because it fails when its done!
