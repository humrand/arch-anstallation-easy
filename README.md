# arch-anstallation-easy
so, i was thinking and i decided to create a python script that makes arch instalation almost automatic. BUT! there may be bugs because its in a super beta, i tested it tho and haven't got any errors, please open a issue if you get an error


# the iso in on releases

Why? because i was bored and decided to do this, but i will update it i promise

# !note!
the script will no longer fail with this new version, i automatized partitioning too and added kde plasma, i added nvidia intel/amd drivers
